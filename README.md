# MULTIPLE WEBCAM RECORDING FOR 3D TRACKING

This project offers a script to record a behaviour on multiple cameras. This can be used for 3D triangulation of motion tracking with, for instance, pose2sim workflow. Additionally, the script uses LSL threading to sychronize the webcam stream with other recorded signals (e.g., audio)
